# Project Title: Natours Backend Clone

## Project Overview
This project is a backend-focused web application that replicates the server-side features and functionality of [Natours](https://www.natours.dev/).

The frontend is already implemented and will be reused.

The goal is to build a comprehensive and robust backend application by applying modern web development techniques and technologies, including API development, database integration, and deployment.

## Tech Stack
The following technologies will be used to develop this project:

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for handling routes, middleware, and APIs efficiently.

### Database:
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, providing schema validation and query building.

### Authentication & Security:
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and authorization.
- **Helmet.js**: To secure HTTP headers.
- **Express Rate Limit**: To prevent brute-force attacks.

### DevOps:
- **Git**: For version control.
- **Postman**: For API testing.

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to:

1. Build a comprehensive understanding of backend development by creating a server-side application from scratch.
2. Enhance skills in Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
3. Implement industry best practices for coding, database design, and security.
4. Learn how to manage application state, handle user authentication, and secure APIs.
5. Gain experience in deploying backend applications to production environments.
6. Showcase a polished project that demonstrates practical expertise and problem-solving skills in backend development.
